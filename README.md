# Auction app

This is the backend for an auction app. The [frontend I developed](https://github.com/olliechick/auctions-frontend) is based on a backend the tutor wrote, which is slightly different to mine.

You can see a live version of that at [olliechick.co.nz/auctions](http://olliechick.co.nz/auctions).
